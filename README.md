# cet

crystal port of cetus file manager/navigator (ruby)

This is my first crystal program, for learning.

`cetus` is my file-manager and action launcher written in ruby. This repo is WIP and is, by no means, usable or error-free.

In case you check this out, do give me suggestions about better coding practices.
